# slicer_tools

A library of python tools for working with 3D slicer files (.3mf). Currently the
library supports Bambu Studio on the following very limited function set:
- Comparison of printer presets across multiple files. Comparisons are presented
as Excel (.xlsx, readable by LibreOffice) files, which detail the differences between
presets in all of the selected files and the system presets. The main purpose of this
is to extract common settings from multiple files, but may also be useful in debugging
files with many changes.
- A dumper that will export all settings contained in preset (generated by walking
the preset inheritance tree).
